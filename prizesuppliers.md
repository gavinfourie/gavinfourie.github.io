# INVITATION TO BECOME A PRIZE SUPPLIER FOR THE LUCKY GARAGE

The Lucky Garage is a new app-based, *skill*-based competition platform created by Coffee & Cars SA. The platform features premium vehicles, motorbikes, services and lifestyle products as prizes, and it offers excellent exposure for reputable suppliers like yourself.


## How the Competition Works

The Lucky Garage operates as a **legal skill-based competition**:

1. Your business supplies a prize (vehicle, bike, service, accessory, etc.)

2. You remain the legal owner throughout the competition

3. Entrants purchase digital tickets through the app

4. Each ticket allows the entrant to answer a skill-based question

5. Only correct answers qualify for the final randomised draw

6. Once the competition is complete and the funds are released, you transfer the prize directly to the verified winner

This structure is transparent, compliant and risk-free for the Supplier.
